# SI-Planner
Smart Integrations Planner

## About
For my first year software engineering course I wrote this program to help in planning and billing of customer project hours.

The idea is that several integration sources can be used to retrieve planning, and output integrations can be used to bill hours.

The current state is experimental alpha.

## Features
* Export to excel using an excel template to bill project hours.
* Data can be saved to a sqlite or mysql database.
* Import of outlook calendar events from office 365.
  * Support federated identities.
